# Noise reduction application based on Spectral Gating using STFT

A non-stationary noise reduction algorithm is designed to remove noise from a signal where the noise characteristics change over time. Unlike stationary noise, which remains relatively constant, non-stationary noise fluctuates or evolves over the duration of the signal.

Adaptive filtering algorithms often employ techniques such as spectral subtraction, to estimate and attenuate the noise in the signal adaptively. These methods analyze the statistical properties of the signal and noise to dynamically update filter coefficients, ensuring efficient noise reduction across changing noise conditions.
